What does the model achieve?
- Derives a linear correlation between volume and weight

How should metrics be interpreted?
- Slope is the relationship between volume and Weight for the modelled data

What are appropriate use cases?
You can calculate the weight if given the volume, or vice versa using the correlation

How is it implemented? *
- If the volume of the object is measured, the weight can be calculated if it is unreasonable to weigh the object

It is okay to recognize limits of your expertise

It is NOT okay to misuse/misinterpret/misreport!

What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
-There may be outliers that are not represented in the data and do not follow the correlation.  The small dataset does not represent this well

How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps
Volume and weight are correlated, which can be used to calculate the density of the object.
